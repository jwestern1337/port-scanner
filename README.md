# port-scanner

A basic port scanner i made in python. 

=========================================================
UPDATE (3rd of march 2022):
  - added threading, so much faster now
  - reduced amount of code from 60 to 51 lines
  - removed choosing amount of ports to scan (automatically scans all 65535 ports now)
  - removed ability to chose delay between each port (may add back in future)

ROADMAP:
  - add a cli option, so you can just do `python portscanner.py -t 127.0.0.1` etc etc
  - add a banner
  - add an internet check
  - released a compiled version
  - possibly progress bar (idk)
