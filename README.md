# port-scanner

A basic port scanner i made in python. 

UPDATE (13th of march 2022):
  - added threading, so much faster now
  - reduced amount of code from 60 to 51 lines
  - removed choosing amount of ports to scan (automatically scans all 65535 ports now)
  - removed ability to chose delay between each port (may add back in future)
  - added a cli option, so you can now do `python portscanner.py {target}` (without the '{}')
  - added a banner
  - added an interent check
  - released a compiled version


Well, i've done everything i want to do with this script so i will no longer be updating it (unless it breaks for some reason)
